# Bullseye

Bullseye takes high resolution accurate masses obtained from FTICR mass spectra and matches 
these masses to tandem MS scan events. The MS/MS spectra can then be database searched with 
a narrow precursor ion mass to reduce database search space and improve peptide sequence 
identification.
