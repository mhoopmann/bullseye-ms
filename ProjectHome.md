Bullseye takes high resolution accurate masses obtained from FTICR mass spectra and matches these masses to tandem MS scan events. The MS/MS spectra can then be database searched with a narrow precursor ion mass to reduce database search space and improve peptide sequence identification.

Bullseye requires the MSToolkit for file reading and writing. It can be found at: https://code.google.com/p/mstoolkit/
